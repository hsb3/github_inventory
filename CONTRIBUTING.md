# Contributing to GitHub Inventory

Thank you for your interest in GitHub Inventory! 

## 🎓 Personal Learning Project

This repository represents my personal learning journey with Python development and GitHub tooling. While I'm grateful for any interest in the project, **I'm not actively seeking external contributions at this time**.

As a learning developer, I'm not equipped to manage issues, review pull requests, or provide ongoing support for external contributors.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues (Limited Support)

If you encounter bugs, you're welcome to report them by creating an issue, but please understand:

- **Limited response time**: I may not be able to respond quickly or at all
- **No guarantee of fixes**: Issues may remain open indefinitely
- **Self-service preferred**: Please try troubleshooting on your own first

When reporting, please include basic information:
- Your operating system and Python version
- The exact command you ran
- The error message you received

## 💡 Feature Requests

I'm not accepting feature requests at this time, as this project serves my specific learning needs. However, you're absolutely welcome to fork the repository and adapt it for your own use!

## 🚫 Pull Requests Not Accepted

I'm not accepting pull requests at this time. This keeps the project manageable for me as I learn and prevents me from having to review or maintain code I'm not ready to support.
